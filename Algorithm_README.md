# Number Guessing Game Algorithm

## Steps to follow

1. Start 
2. Generate a random number between **1 and 10**, and store it into a variable.  
3. Let a variable guess be set to **0** (or any number not equal to generated random number variable).  
4. Repeat the steps below until the players guess equals random number generated:  
   1. Prompt the user to enter a guess between 1 and 10.  
   2. Read the user’s input and store it in the guess variable.  
   3. If guess < random number generated:  
      - Display "Your guess is too low, Try again."  
   4. Else if guess > random number generated:  
      - Display "Your guess is too high, Try again."  
   5. Else (i.e guess = random number):  
      - Display "Congratulations, You guessed the correct number."  
5. End
